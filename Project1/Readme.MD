This project is a simple representation for the learning of PYQt and pthon script. As a result, we have made an interface for getting the temperature and humidity values on Qt and command line.
As a result, we are getting values of humidity and temperature showing an error incase data is asked for but not received.
For extra credit purposes, we have stored the values in a buffer for historical display over time with a timer running.
Also implemented an alarm system if the temperature threshold is exceeded.
Some added functionality of File-> Close and Edit-> Clear on the Toolbar
